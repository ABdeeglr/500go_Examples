# README

It's just a go learning log.

## Plan

1. [x] Arrays/Slices/Maps/Range
2. Nest week: Function part and Struct part

## Questions

1. What's difference between `Print()` `Print;n()` `Printf()`? Why so much?
2. There come up with a function statemaent firstly in switch.go. I need to got it.
3. Why switch syntax in go allows to use non-number as case value?
4. Why type slices are independent from arrays in go? What's the history of slices?

## Answer

1. [Q3] https://www.notion.so/abdeeglr/Switch-C-Go-cfc1fbc6ebcd466384536ac6efac779c
2. [Q4] It's simply because slices are mutaible, but arrays are static.
3. [\*Q1] Println() means print the content always in one line. Printf() is succeed from C. For now I don't know Print().
